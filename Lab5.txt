Lab 5. Consolidated Exercise

1.1. There are two types of employees in our organization: Regular and Contract.
Regular employees are on rolls of the organization and are entitled for various
allowances and benefits like HRA, Conveyance, Medical reimbursements, LTA and
Special allowances, along with basic salary. Regular Employee is also entitled for 10
days of CL and 30 days of PL every year. The contract employees on the other hand
are entitled for Basic and Conveyance. Contract Employee is also allotted 1 day of
leave every month and no other. As per government rules, PF is 12 % of Basic and is
deducted from all employees (employers contribution being 13 %). Tax is deducted
from all employees as applicable depending on the gross salary of the employees.
Design the class hierarchy. You may have additional classes also as applicable.

Answer:

 class Regular
     {
         public float HRA, Conveyance, Medicalreimbursements, LTA, Specialallowances,gross;
         public float gross,Basic,pf; 
         public float Netsalary,Deduction;
          void regularPF(int salary)
           {
             
             Basic=salary;
             pf=(Basic*12)/100;
             gross=Basic+HRA+Conveyance+Medicalreimbursements+LTA+Special allowances //It calculate total gross salary of regular employee;
           }
 
           void regLeave()
           {
            int cl=10.pl=30;
           }

           void regularTaxDeduction()
           {
           
              Deduction=gross-pf;//Tax Deduction 
              Netsalary=Gross-Deduction;//Net salary 
           }
            
          
     }
     class Contract
     {
      public float Basic,Conveyance
      public float int pf,gross;
      public float Netsalary,Deduction;
          void contractPF(int salary)
          {
             Basic=salary;
             pf=(Basic*12)/100;
             gross=Basic+Conveyance;//Calculates Gross Salary Of Contract Employees
          }
          void contractTaxDeduction()
          {
              Deduction=gross-pf;//Tax Deduction 
              Netsalary=Gross-Deduction;//Net salary 
          }
          void conLeave()
          {
             int leave=1,totalLeave;
             totalLeave=1*12;  /* 1 day leave every month,so total leave of 1 year  
                                will be 12 for contract employees 
          }
     }
 
     class Organization 
     {
           public static void main(String args[])
           { 
               Regular r=new Regular();
               Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
               System.out.println("Enter Salary");
               rsalary=sc.nextInt();
               r.regularPF(rsalary);
               r.regLeave();
               r.regularTaxDeduction();
               Contract c=new Contract();

               csalary=sc.nextInt();
               c.contractPF(csalary);
               c.conLeave();
               c.contractTaxDeduction();
           }
     }
